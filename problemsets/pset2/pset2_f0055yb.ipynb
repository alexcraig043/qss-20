    "\n",
    "By investigating disparities in sentencing between black defendants and white defendants, this problem set will give you practice with:\n",

    "- Defining your own functions\n",

    "We will use the Cook County, Illinois (which contains Chicago) sentencing dataset. This analysis could be extended to study Hispanic defendants or, in a different jurisdiction, Asian and other minoritized groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataset reports the sentence given to defendants convicted of different crimes, and you can find [the data codebook here](https://datacatalog.cookcountyil.gov/api/views/tg8v-tm6u/files/8597cdda-f7e1-44d1-b0ce-0a4e43f8c980?download=true&filename=CCSAO%20Data%20Glossary.pdf) and the latest on these data [at the official website](https://datacatalog.cookcountyil.gov/Courts/Sentencing/tg8v-tm6u).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Details if interested in digging deeper** (optional): There is a lot to think about here in terms of (1) how we might measure disparities, and (2) what factors you would want to adjust for when deciding whether two defendants are 'similarly situated' but for their race. You can read more technical coverage in the following sources:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Review of sentencing disparities research](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/full/10.1086/701505)\n",
    "- [Discussion of causal model/blinding race at charging stage of the prosecutorial process](https://5harad.com/papers/blind-charging.pdf)\n",
    "- [Discussion of measuring discrimination in policing that can generalize to the sentencing case](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev-criminol-011518-024731)\n",
    "- [General discussion of causal challenges in measuring between-group disparities](https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/gx4y3/)\n",
    "\n",
    "**One major caveat**: when comparing whether two similar defendants received different sentences, we're missing one important attribute that influences sentencing: the defendant's criminal history. This influences sentencing both through sentencing guidelines, which can prescribe longer sentences for those who have certain types of prior convictions, and through judicial discretion if judges are more lenient with first-time defendants. The above sources discuss how much we want to \"control away\" for this prior history, since if we think there are racial biases in which defendants, conditional on *committing* a crime, are arrested and charged, we may not want to adjust for that factor."

    "1. Create a December 2016 object and use that to create a range corresponding to the bandwidth.\n",
    "2. Filter to rows within December 2016 +- that # of months. For example, for the 2-month bandwidth, the \"before\" period is Oct and Nov 2016; after is Jan and Feb 2017. Instead of using timedelta to increment in time (as we did in class function activity), use [**relativedelta**](https://dateutil.readthedocs.io/en/stable/relativedelta.html) to increment in months.\n",
    "3. Within that filtered dataset, examine Black-White disparities in incarceration before versus after. One shortcut for doing this is to keep the full dataframe together and construct an `is_after` indicator (e.g., using `np.where()`) that takes the value of `True` if after Dec 2016 (and otherwise is `False`), and then group by that and a categorical race variable. This step produces a single dataframe for each time window--e.g., a dataframe for the 2-month bandwidth, a dataframe for the 4-month one, etc. \n",
    "4. Use `pd.concat` to combine those dataframes into a single dataframe.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint on output:** The table you make should have two Black-white disparities per bandwidth: one disparity (e.g., a 10 percentage point difference in incarceration rates) before the policy change and another disparity after (e.g., a 5 percentage point difference in incarceration rates). "
